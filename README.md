Habular

Although naturally viewed as a tree, a hash is often structured in a way that a tabular view is
both applicable and better suited to inspection. Habular defines and implements a conversion of
hash to equivalent data structure which may be easily rendered as a table (similar to the
[`console.table` API](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks#console-table)
found in Chrome's devtools).

This is a very early revision. Further documentation is forthcoming.
